*This program can be ran on any PC, as long as all of the files remain in the same folder*

  This program initializes with the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music and scrapes the words into a custom 
  HashTable with a cache for each Wiki page linked to it. The user can then enter a URL to any webpage and a cosine similarity 
  will be done to recommend the top 10 Wikipedia pages within the database! This program creates a B-Tree which was persistent 
  in the last assignment, but has been thoroughly tested with Wiki pages. I decided to store the entire parser persistently in 
  order to speed up load time as well, and a graph has been implemented for traversal of directly linked pages using Dijkstra's 
  shortest path algorithm. This algorithm is used for finding the shortest path between two Wiki pages typed in by the user(As 
  long as those pages are in the database).
